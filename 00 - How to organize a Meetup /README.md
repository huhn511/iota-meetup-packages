# How to organise a Meetup 

The biggest effort to organize a meetup is in the planning phase before the meetup. This guideline is written by the IOTA Foundation and the IOTA Community and gives you an easy guideline which you can follow to organize your IOTA Meetup in your city. 

We also provide a checklist, which helps you to remember the important to-dos in each meetup phase.

Each meetup has 3 different phases

- pre-phase -  all things on before meetup (location, speakers, etc.) 
- meetup phase - all things on the meetup (live presentation, speaker support, catering, etc.  
- post phase - all things after a meetup (collect images, statistics, etc.)

## Pre Meetup Phase

- Choose a Meetup Date - Take a good date in the future. The best Meetup day is Thursday in the evening.
- Search for Team (Optional) - It's easier and funnier with some friends
- Find a location
- Find the speakers and create an agenda 
- Make a project timeline with to dos and deadline
- Create a Meetup on Meetup.com
- Catering - don't forget vegetarians and vegans. 
- Find a photograph and/or video maker. You could also ask in the community for that. 

## Meetup Phase - The Meetup Day
- Just relax - the most work is done and enjoys your Meetup!
- Have nice conversations. 
- Answer the following questions
   - How many people are here?
   - Are IF Members around there? Connect with them (maybe they also want to speak on your next Meetup)

## Post Meetup Phase
- Get the images and videos and send them to reporters (IOTA Foundation, einfachIOTA, etc.)
- Thank everyone. 
- Ask for Feedback.
- Notify everyone about whatâ€™s next.
